# Sprint Backlog

## Overview
The Sprint Backlog is a list of tasks identified by the Scrum team to be completed during the sprint. It is a subset of the Product Backlog and is used to track progress during the sprint.

## Key Components
- **Tasks**: Activities required to complete user stories.
- **Status**: Current status of each task (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Estimates**: Time or effort required to complete each task.

## Sprint Goal
Enhance user authentication and account management modules for the bank's online portal.

- **To Do**: Task has not been started.
- **In Progress**: Task is currently being worked on.
- **Done**: Task has been completed.

## Capacity Planning
The team uses story points and hours to estimate the effort required for each task and ensure the workload is manageable within the sprint duration.

### Team Capacity
- Emma White: 8 days
- John Lee: 8 days
- Michael Brown: 8 days

### Total Estimates
- US001: 7 days
- US002: 8 days
- US003: 9 days

## Daily Standup
Daily standups are held to ensure alignment and track progress. Team members provide updates on what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and any impediments they are facing.

## Risk Management
- **Potential Risks**:
  - Delays in API development.
  - Unclear requirements for the registration process.
  - Integration challenges between frontend and backend.

- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Regular check-ins and progress reviews.
  - Clarify requirements with stakeholders before starting development.
  - Allocate buffer time for integration tasks.

## Conclusion
The Sprint Backlog is a dynamic document that evolves as the team progresses through the sprint. Regular updates and clear communication ensure that the team stays on track to achieve the sprint goals.
