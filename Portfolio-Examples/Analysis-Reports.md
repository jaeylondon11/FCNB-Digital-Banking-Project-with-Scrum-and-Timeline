# Analysis Reports

## Overview
This document presents the analysis reports generated during the project lifecycle. It includes data analysis, risk analysis, and performance analysis to inform decision-making and ensure project success.

## Data Analysis

### User Feedback Analysis
- **Method**: Surveys and interviews conducted with a sample of 500 users.
- **Findings**:
  - 85% of users find the current login process cumbersome.
  - 70% of users would like to see a more detailed transaction history.
  - 60% of users requested an easier way to contact customer support.

### Usage Statistics
- **Method**: Analysis of usage logs from the current online portal.
- **Findings**:
  - Peak usage occurs between 6 PM and 9 PM.
  - The average session duration is 5 minutes.
  - Most common user actions are checking account balances and viewing transaction history.

## Risk Analysis

### Potential Risks
1. **Security Breaches**
   - **Impact**: High
   - **Likelihood**: Medium
   - **Mitigation**: Implement multi-factor authentication and conduct regular security audits.
2. **Project Delays**
   - **Impact**: Medium
   - **Likelihood**: High
   - **Mitigation**: Adopt agile methodologies and maintain clear communication channels.
3. **Integration Issues**
   - **Impact**: Medium
   - **Likelihood**: Medium
   - **Mitigation**: Allocate buffer time for integration tasks and conduct thorough testing.

## Performance Analysis

### Load Testing
- **Method**: Simulated load testing using JMeter.
- **Findings**:
  - The portal can handle up to 8,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
  - Response time increases significantly beyond 8,000 concurrent users.

### Stress Testing
- **Method**: Stress testing using LoadRunner.
- **Findings**:
  - The system remains stable under stress conditions up to 12,000 concurrent users.
  - System performance degrades gracefully beyond 12,000 users, with response times increasing but no crashes.

## Conclusion
These analysis reports provide valuable insights into user needs, potential risks, and system performance. The findings and recommendations will guide the project to ensure it meets user expectations and performs reliably.
